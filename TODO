--> mr_rt_vars              :: provide option to user for hardcoding variables, And add this as part of script execution.
                                So on every replay, this variable will be hardcoded and inserted into rt_vars.
--> mr_trigger              ::  trigger a external python script which might initiate a traffic send.
--> mr_read_and_configure   ::  read line by line from a text file and execute command as if user is typing it on terminal.
                                This will help to speed up process of json generation.
                                If there is a show command, wait for users input to select watchers.

--> change all string based search to pattern based search to match the whole word
--> provide pattern based search in show op.
    ex:
        "D1-2": {
        "cmd": "sudo udldctl port D1P1",
        "watchers": [
            {
                "watch-key": "PORT"
            },
            {
                "CFG_AGGR": "N",
                "CFG_ENABLE": "Y",
                "NBR_DEVID": "",
                "NBR_DEVID_LEN": "",
                "NBR_MSGTIME": "",
                "NBR_PORTID": "",
                "NBR_PORTID_LEN": "",
                "NBR_TIMEOUT": "",
                "OPER_LNSTATE": "DOWN",
                "OPER_OPCODE": "PROBE",
                "OPER_PHASE": "LINKUP",
                "OPER_UDLDSTATE": "INDETERM",
                "PORT": "26"                            >>>> cant be provided as a generic pattern in topo.py.
            }
        ]
    }

    to address such issue.
    ask the user if he would like to create a new variable for that particular field check.
    and create a new variable automatically and append to topo.py's list of variables.

    also it would be better if we can provide an option to input a regex against which user would like to do a match.
    This will help to monitor dynamically changing values like counters.

 - generate test_case as a self-contained independent python file, anyone can execute it from anywhere.
    	usecase : when submitter reports a issue., there is always a big fight over how to reproduce the issue.
			  This will solve the problem. submitter can reproduce once manually and share the python script for reproduction.

 - add exec mode. exec show version >> should run in exec mode, should not be added to tc_file.
 - do not sort watchers based on key in json file. let it be as it is in the show command output order.
 - replace dut port names with variables. helps to run automation on any device any port. Just by changing the topo.py
 - Create new variables from output ? add default option as N, so just by pressing enter N should be taken
 --> mr_append               ::  open a existing tc_file and add new commands to it.
